# Titanic - Decision Tree Model

## Overview
This project aims to predict the survival of passengers aboard the Titanic using a Decision Tree Classifier. It is part of my learning journey in machine learning.

## Dataset
The dataset used is the famous **Titanic dataset**. It contains information about passengers such as age, sex, class, and whether they survived.

## Project Structure
- **Data Loading and Preprocessing**: 
  - Loading the dataset.
  - Handling missing values.
  - Encoding categorical variables.
  - Feature selection.
- **Model Building**:
  - Training a Decision Tree Classifier.
  - Visualizing the tree structure.
- **Model Evaluation**:
  - Assessing performance with accuracy score and confusion matrix.
  - Analyzing feature importance.

## Model accuracy
The model used here is a Decision Tree Classifier from the sklearn library. The achieved accuracy of 80% indicates that the model performs well in predicting passenger survival based on the selected features.
